  <h2>Perks of PhD studies: GTA</h2>
  <br>
    <p class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom:5">One of the perks of studying for a PhD is the great opportunity to work as a graduate teaching assistant (GTA), particularly a lab demonstrator in my case. I initially preferred labs which weren’t much challenging, since I was inexperienced and afraid of not managing to meet students’ expectations and needs. I soon realised how wrong I was. Now that all face-to-face teaching has been indefinitely suspended, I every now and then catch myself recalling memories from past lab sessions. And I realised how much I appreciate what I’ve gained from the challenging moments, whether these happened in 'easier' or more 'difficult' labs: they taught me how to deal with frustration, pressure, learners’ diversity, cultural diversity, knowledge gaps. They also introduced me to other areas of Computer Science, where I had the opportunity to meet and work with interesting and inspiring people. So, retrospectively, it’s safe to say that I’ve wholeheartedly enjoyed my time spent as a TA by now. And that’s what I’ve been missing the most: students raising hands, asking questions which either can be easily answered by just guiding the student to discover the answer, or challenge my skills and knowledge.</p>
    <p class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom:5">Clearly, as a TA I have much less responsibilities than a teacher has. However, I can still have an impact in the teaching process. It is important for this impact to be as good as it can. Of course, there will be some mistakes; if they can be corrected, it’s perfect; if not, unfortunately you have to get in terms with it and move on, learning how to not repeat them. What counts more during the whole process?
    <ol>
      <li>To make the students feel comfortable with their mistakes and their questions. They have just started learning, and learning takes time and effort; shame and hesitation should not be added in the list!</li>
      <li>To inspire the students (ok, this is a bit hard for a TA). Give them the information they need, without exaggerating, without being more or less formal than needed. Find the correct balance, and praise them for their progress or their creative personal approach.</li>
      <li>Don’t forget that it’s a job, and, as such, it has some boundaries you shouldn’t cross. Don’t be more or less friendly nor more or less formal than you should. Sometimes you can help more than how much you’re being paid for, while others you cannot (or shouldn’t).</li>
      <li>Don’t forget that they are students, and they are concerned about their studies, their progress, their marks. A session not going as well as expected may be of minor importance to you, but students can feel really lost, angry, devastated, demotivated. They consider you to have loads of knowledge and potential, but in a different form than you actually do and need to have them. Try to detect and handle situations which affect students in a negative way, show that you are aware of them and you actively try to fix them.</li>
      <li>The purpose for you is to lead them to the answer. Sometimes you have to reveal the answer, due to time or other constraints, but try to make sure that you gave the answer directly only for a good reason, and otherwise go for the socratic method; it’s more effective, fruitful, and can be fun too!</li>
      <li>Different students have different behaviours and reactions. It’s not always a matter of culture; character and special learning needs are also important. Be ready to deal with the unexpected. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. I've came across reactions which have been really unexpected and funny at the same time, for both the student and me!</li>
    </ol></p>
    <p class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom:5">Of course, since I love being a GTA, I still recall the last lab session. Not literally the last one, but actually the last one that took place physically and not virtually; it's a completely different experience. It was the first lab session of a Robotics module, in which we were using the adorable MiRo robots. As such, I was really anxious, and very well prepared. It went nice. We were having fun with the other GTAs, as back then we thought that we wouldn't be affected by the coronavirus pandemic anytime soon, and we definitely couldn't expect that the university would close the day after...</p>
    <p class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom:5">Can't wait to return to my favourite Diamond labs!</p>
