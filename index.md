## Welcome!

I am a Computer Science graduate, with an MA in Cognitive Studies (where I focused on Language Cognition and Computer Science).
I am currently exploring Natural Language Processing using Python 3.

In this website you can join me during this exploration. There will definitely be music in the background.

The first stops of this journey include the following resources:

1. [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/): A nice introductory online book, which explores the NLTK module. The [first edition](http://www.nltk.org/book_1ed/) used Python 2.
I have [solved some of the programming exercises](https://github.com/vpapg/NLTK_book_py3), and I aim to solve the rest soon. You are free to point out possible mistakes or inefficient solutions, or to discuss different approaches.

2. [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/%7Ejurafsky/slp3/): A draft of a forthcoming book, which covers a large range of topics in more detail than the one in the 1st stop. I am planning to try the programming exercises too, after having read a part of it.

3. [Peter Norvig's webpage](http://norvig.com/): Norvig is one of the authors of one of the most famous [books](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) about Artificial Intelligence. In his website there are some useful guides and code in Python and other languages. And, of course, NLP-related material.

Let the journey begin!
