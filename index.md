## Welcome!

I am a Computer Science graduate, with an MA in Cognitive Studies (where I focused on Language Cognition and Computer Science).
I am currently exploring Natural Language Processing using Python 3.

In this website you can join me during this exploration. There will definitely be music in the background.
